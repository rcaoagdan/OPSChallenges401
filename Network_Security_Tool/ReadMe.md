## Overview
Tools like Nmap are quite useful on their own, but what about customizing its capabilities? Because we know a little Python, we can explore creating our own network scanning tool with the Python library Scapy. Today youâ€™ll begin development of your own network scanning tool.

## Part 1: 
In Python, create a TCP Port Range Scanner that tests whether a TCP port is open or closed. The script must:

* Utilize the scapy library
* Define host IP
* Define port range or specific set of ports to scan
* Test each port in the specified range using a for loop
    * If flag 0x12 received, send a RST packet to graciously close the open connection. Notify the user the port is open.
    * If flag 0x14 received, notify user the port is closed.
    * If no flag is received, notify the user the port is filtered and silently dropped.
