### Overview
Detection and remediation of malware is the core function of many security products, and an optional secondary feature on others like perimeter firewalls and proxy servers.

### Requirements

In Python, write a script that will:

* Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for.
* Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
* Search each file in the directory by name.
* Recursively scan each file and folder in the user input directory path and print it to the screen.
* For each file scanned within the scope of your search directory:
* Generate the file’s MD5 hash using Hashlib.
* Assign the MD5 hash to a variable.
* Download virustotal-search.py and place it in the same folder as the demo Python script.
* Successfully connect to the VirusTotal API
* Automatically compare your target file’s md5 hash with the hash values of entries on VirusTotal API
* Print to the screen the number of positives detected and total files scanned

** demo.py was used as refeced, and utlized as a function. ** 

The script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10.
