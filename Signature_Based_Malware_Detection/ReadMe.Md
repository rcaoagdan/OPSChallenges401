Detection and remediation of malware is the core function of many security products, and an optional secondary feature on others like perimeter firewalls and proxy servers.

* Prompt the user to type in a file name to search for.
* Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
* Search each file in the directory by name.

___TIP: You may need to perform different commands depending on what OS youâ€™re executing the script on.____
* For each positive detection, print to the screen the file name and location.
* At the end of the search process, print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found.
